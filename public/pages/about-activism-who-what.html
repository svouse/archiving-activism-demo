      <h2>WHO</h2>
      <p class="lede">
        On this platform, you’ll find a collection of ordinary people and organizations that were active in Austin from
        the 1940s to the present. In curating this collection, we focused on student organizations, student-community
        collaborations, and individuals who may not be well-known. While the majority of the people featured here were
        connected to UT-Austin, you will also see some artifacts from activists from Huston-Tillotson and to a very
        limited degree, secondary schools. Here’s a brief list of some of those people and organizations: Community
        United Front (CUF); Mexican American Youth Organization; Gay and Lesbian Students’ Association; Student Athlete
        Coalition; Todos Unidos; Grace Cleaver; Larry Jackson; John Warfield. To learn more about these organizations
        and people and many more, head over to the contextualization tab that shares more about why they are important.

      <h2>WHAT</h2>
      <p class="lede">
        Activism takes many forms, and you will see that reflected in this platform. You will find artifacts from
        students who protested the Vietnam War, students who advocated for starting a Black Studies department,
        students who protested South African Apartheid, students who fought to create community for gays and lesbians
        on campus, and much more. We sorted activism into four categories: direct activism and advocacy, university-
        based politics, pedagogy and training, and public education. To learn more about why we chose these categories,
        head over to the History of the Archiving Activism project page.
